# Learn more about Datasets

Well we all have a basic Idea of what ESGF is, if not please look at this  (`https://intake-esgf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/`)` for a better understanding.

Lets start with every possible question that a newbie like me would have.

## What is Metagrid?

MetaGrid is the next-generation search interface for the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF). It's a user-friendly web application designed to help researchers find and access climate model data stored within the ESGF. Think of it as a more advanced way to search for and retrieve the data needed for climate research. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. ESGF's Role:
The Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) is a global network of data centers that provides access to climate model outputs. It's a crucial resource for climate scientists, particularly for projects like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. 

## MetaGrid's Function:

MetaGrid is the tool that users interact with to search through the vast amount of data available through ESGF. It offers features like: 

1. Facet Value Free-Text Entry: Allows users to quickly find relevant options by typing instead of scrolling through long lists of facets (like model names, variables, etc.). 

2. Saved Searches: Users can save their search queries and reuse them later. 
Shareable Result Links: Enables users to share specific search results with colleagues. 

3. How it helps:
MetaGrid simplifies the process of finding the specific climate data needed for research, making it easier to access and utilize the data available through ESGF.
