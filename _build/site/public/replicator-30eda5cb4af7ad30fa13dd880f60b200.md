# ESGF-NG Replicator
The ESGF-NG Replicator is a service designed to be used by ESGF Data Node operators with the new [ESGF-NG core architecture](https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-roadmap).
* It monitors the ESGF-wide Event Stream.
* When it sees a new ESGF dataset that matches a configured replication policy, it makes a replica of the dataset in configured local storage.
* It updates the configured ESGF STAC Catalogue with information about any replicas it creates.
